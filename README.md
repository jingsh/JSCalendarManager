# JSCalendarManager
An Objective-C class for common calendar and events operations. Requires `EventKit.framework`.
```objective-C
#import <EventKit/EventKit.h>
```

## How to install?
Drag and drop `JSCalendarManager.h` and `JSCalendarManager.m` file into your project. 

## How to use?
In your project, import the class using
```objective-C
#import"JSCalendarManager.h"
```

### Using the manager as singleton object so that the same manager object can be used across different view controllers.
```objective-C
JSCalendarManager *manager = [JSCalendarManager sharedManager];
```

### Or using in single controller or your data model.
```objective-C
JSCalendarManager *manager = [[JSCalendarManager alloc]init];
```
## Defined completion handlers
The class defined three completion handler blocks, the definition are pretty self explanatory. 
### Calendar operation handler block
```objective-C
typedef void (^calendarOperationCompletionHandler)(BOOL success, NSError *error, NSString *calendarIdentifier);
```
The block is called by the calendar operations, such as create or delete calendars in the device's calendar database. It includes a `BOOL success` flag, a `NSError *error` object indicating any errors, and a `NSString *calendarIdentifier` (if any) to indicate which calendar is being created/deleted.

### Events operation handler block
```objective-C
typedef void (^eventsOperationCompletionHandler)(BOOL success, NSError *error, NSString *eventIdentifier);
```
The block is called by event operation methods, such as create/update/delete events in the selected calendar.  It includes a `BOOL success` flag, a `NSError *error` object indicating any errors, and a `NSString *calendarIdentifier` (if any) to indicate the event being created/updated/deleted.

### Event search handler block
```objective-C
typedef void (^eventSearchHandler)(BOOL found, NSError *error, NSArray *eventsArray);
```
The block is called by event searching methods. It includes a `BOOL found` flag, a `NSError *error` object for any errors (`nil` if no errors), and an array of events that being found (`nil` if not found).

## Check/Request calendar permissions
**You MUST call `requestCalendarAccessWithCompletionHandler:` method before you do anything with calendar or events.**

You should prompt user for permissions or notify them that they should enable calendar access from the *Settings* app if they explicitly denied the access before. Example:
```objective-C
[manager requestCalendarAccessWithCompletionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError *error){
	if (granted) {
		NSLog("Granted by user when the system ask-for-permission prompt is shown. Or the user already granted permission before.");	
		//do something else here.
	}
	else{
		NSLog(@"%@",error);
		//do some error handling here.
	}];
```

There are also three methods you can use to check the calendar permissions your app has, and implement your own calendar permission logic based on returned value. The methods are pretty self explanatory.
```objective-C
/*!
 @method     calendarAccessGranted
 @discussion Returns the authorization status for the app
 */
+(BOOL)calendarAccessGranted;

/*!
 @method     shouldRequestCalendarAccess
 @discussion Returns whether should request user to grant access to calendar by the use. Call requestCalendarAccessWithCompletionHandler: method to prompt user for permissions.
 */
+(BOOL)shouldRequestCalendarAccess;

/*!
 @method     shouldGrantAccessManually
 @discussion Returns whether the user has denied or limited the access to calendar.
 */
+(BOOL)shouldGrantAccessManually;
```
**Note:** if the user has explicitly turned off the permisson to calendar before, you can use `shouldGrantAccessManually` method to check this, and prompt an alert view explaining the necessity of access to calendar and show instructions how to turn the permission back on.
```objective-C
	if([manager shouldGrantAccessManually]){
		UIAlertView *alert = [UIAlertView alloc]initWithTitle:@"Needs calendar access" message:@"The app needs to access to your calendar. Please go the Settings app to turn on the permission." delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles:nil, nil];
		[alert show];
	}
```

## Calendar operations
### Create a customize calendar
You can create your own calendar for your app. There are two methods to do this.
```objective-C
/*!
 @method     createCalendar: iCloud: completionHandler:
 @discussion Call this method to create a calendar with the given title. The parameter iCloud indicates whether this calendar is on icloud.
 */
-(void)createCalendar:(NSString *)calendarTitle
			   iCloud:(BOOL)icloud
	completionHandler:(calendarOperationCompletionHandler)handler;
```
This method will creat a local/iCloud calendar with given name. You can also create a local calendar using 
```objective-C
/*!
 @method     createLocalCalendar: completionHandler:
 @discussion Call this method to create a local calendar with the given title.
 */
-(void)createLocalCalendar:(NSString *)calendarTitle
		 completionHandler:(calendarOperationCompletionHandler)handler;
```
The completion handler will include a `(NSString *)eventIdentifier`, you should be responsible for saving this identifier in your app for future use.

### Using availabe calendars
If you saved the calendar identifier before, you can set the calendar you want to use using
```objective-C
[manager setUsingCalendar:KNOWN_CALENDAR_IDENTIFIER];
```
You must set the calendar you wish to use, otherwise the default calendar in your app will be used. 
If possible, we recommend creating your own calendar. Therefore, the user's other calendar will not be left alone, incase user accidentally deletes/messes their calendars/events.

If you don't know the calendar identifier, don't worry, you can pull a list of calendars available on the device, and pick one or let user pick one.
```obejective-C
NSArray *calendars = [manager allCalendars];
for (EKCalendar *cal in calendars){
  NSLog(@"%@",cal.calendarIdentifier);
  //do something here.
}
```  

## TODO:
1. More documentation.
2. Add support for reminders.
3. Swift version.
